Cricket is a popular bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of eleven players, centered around a 22-yard
pitch with wickets at each end, where one team bats to score runs and the other bowls and fields to dismiss
batters, with the goal of scoring more runs to win; originating in England, it's a globally loved game with
diverse formats, from short T20s to multi-day matches, demanding skill, fitness, and strategic teamwork,
fostering strong community spirit, especially in Commonwealth nations like India, Australia, and the
West Indies.
